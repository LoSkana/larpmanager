        Authenticate user with username/password allowing email or username.

        Attempts to authenticate a user by checking both username and email fields
        for a match. This allows users to login with either their username or email
        address. Implements timing attack protection for non-existent users.

        Args:
            request: HTTP request object (may be None in Django <2.1)
            username: Username or email address for authentication
            password: Plain text password for authentication
            **kwargs: Additional authentication parameters including USERNAME_FIELD

        Returns:
            Authenticated user object if credentials are valid, None otherwise

        Note:
            Django <2.1 does not pass the request parameter.
