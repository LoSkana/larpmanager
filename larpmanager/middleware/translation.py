    This middleware intercepts each request and injects association-specific

    each organization to customize specific translation strings without modifying
    the global .po files.

    The middleware:
    1. Checks if the request is associated with a specific organization
    2. Loads custom translations for that organization from cache
    3. Wraps the standard Django translation with custom overrides
    4. Cleans up after the response is sent

    This enables multi-tenant translation customization where different
    organizations can see different text for the same UI elements.
