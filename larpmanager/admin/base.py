def reduced(value: str | None) -> str:
    """Truncate string to maximum length with ellipsis.

    Truncates the input string to a maximum of 50 characters. If the string
    is longer than the limit, it's cut off and "[...]" is appended to indicate
    truncation.

    Args:
        value: String to potentially truncate. Can be None or empty.

    Returns:
        Original string if under 50 chars, otherwise truncated with [...] suffix.
        Returns empty string or None as-is if input is falsy.

    Examples:
        >>> reduced("short")
        'short'
        >>> reduced("a" * 60)
        'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa[...]'
        >>> reduced(None)
        None
