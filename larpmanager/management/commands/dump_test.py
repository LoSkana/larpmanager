        Django management command handler to dump test database.

        This function resets the database, applies migrations, and creates a clean
        SQL dump file for testing purposes. The dump is cleaned of PostgreSQL-specific
        commands that may cause issues during test restoration.

        Args:
            *args: Command line arguments passed to the management command
            **kwargs: Command line keyword arguments passed to the management command
