        """Database reset command with fixtures loading.

        Truncates all database tables and reloads initial fixtures. Supports
        both PostgreSQL and SQLite databases with appropriate reset strategies.

        Args:
            *args: Command line arguments passed to the management command
            **options: Dictionary of command options and flags

        Returns:

        Raises:
            DatabaseError: If database operations fail during truncation
            CommandError: If fixture loading fails

        Side Effects:
            - Truncates all database tables
            - Resets auto-increment sequences
            - Loads initial fixtures via init_db command
